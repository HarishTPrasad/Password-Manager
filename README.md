# Password-Manager
# Simple Password Manager

A basic password manager implemented in Python for educational purposes. This project demonstrates storing and retrieving passwords using a simplified encryption method (Caesar cipher) and SQLite database.

## Features

- Store passwords securely in a database.
- Retrieve passwords for specific websites.
- Basic encryption using a Caesar cipher (for educational purposes only).
- SQLite database for data storage.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Setup

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install any required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install sqlite3


   Usage
Run the password_manager.py script using a Python interpreter.
Follow the menu prompts to store and retrieve passwords.
Note: This example uses a simplified Caesar cipher for encryption, which is not secure for actual password management. It is recommended to use established encryption libraries for real-world applications.
